## Data dictionary
I've tried to reproduce that natural categories of division that the journal offers.

### Division types (regular issues)
- article
- section (the type of which is designated with the "feature" attribute, listed below)

### Division types (index)
- frontMatter: the title pages of a journal. Usually there is only one set per volume.
- index: various indexes appearing at the end of the year. Includes tables of contents.

### Features
This attribute describes discrete sections that recur from issue to issue, under the following headings:
- Comptes Rendus
- Bulletin
- Liste des Membres
- Séances, etc. (various meetings and official business of the societies)
- Liste des Lois
- Variétés

### Changes over time
- Early issues are almost entirely meeting minutes. Minutes end with time that meeting closed.
- Table of Contents begins volume 2 (1873).
- "Reunions/Travaux des Sections" section begins 3.3 (1874), initially containing Comptes Rendus and Chronique Legislative.
- Vol 8 (1879) Comptes Rendus and Chronique become top level sections.
- Conseil de Direction minutes are own section.
- Volume 11 (1882) is first that does not include meeting minutes. At this point, minutes are in issues 1, 3, 5, and 7 of each volume.
